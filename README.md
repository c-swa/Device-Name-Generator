# Device Name Generator

## Introduction
This application was created from an idea of a tech joke I made with friends, on the recommendation a fellow student. 
One day I was naming my devices a series of comical names, "FBI-SecurityVan-28" and "CIA-IceCreamTruck-93", a friend, who gave me the inspiration to create this application also has a GitHub where you can find him [here](https://amadeusine.github.io/)

So, thanks for reading, the rest of this file will contain the instructions, as well as documentation for the use and creation of the file. 
I won't really say much here during the development of the program while I create it, but I'll definitely be updating my blog, so [check me out](https://christopherswayne.com/)
